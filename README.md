# XNALabyrinth
A C# 3D Labyrinth Game based on XNA framework that I developed for the Computer Graphics course with the help of a classmate. 

It can run on Windows, Xbox 360, and, in theory, Windows Phone (RIP) if you found any such device! It is based on XNA 4.0 framwwork and at minimum requires .NET framework 4.0 as well as Visual Studio 2010 for development. To run this game on a computer running a Windows operating system, you need a graphics card that supports, at minimum, Shader Model 1.1 and DirectX 9.0c.
